The code must be no more than 9 characters long, and we have to be able to get the following information out:
- Which store does the code belong to?
- Which date was the code issued?
- Which customer (transaction) did the docket belong to (a number starting again at 1 every day)
Consider how easy it is for the end users to read/copy the code into the website and how we can prevent cheaters.
Write the methods for generating + decoding this unique code that will be printed on the docket by forking the following Pen:
